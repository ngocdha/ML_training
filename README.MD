# My first Machine Learning training course

This repo contains my solutions to the exercises of the ML course by Andrew Ng on Coursera.

## Personal takeaway:

### Week 2

- For **gradient descent**: check, double-check, triple-check if the code is really updating theta *simultaneously*. Do NOT partially update theta.

- Always try to *generalize* the code. This means that the code should work for different data sets with different number of features and examples.

- For using theta to make **prediction**: check if data has been normalized or not *prior* to estimating.
